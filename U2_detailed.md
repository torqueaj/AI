## Problem-Solving and Search Methods

This repository provides a comprehensive summary of various problem-solving and search methods commonly used in computer science and artificial intelligence. Each method is explained in terms of its definition, types, steps, advantages, disadvantages, and common problem domains where they are applied.

### Search Strategies

Search strategies are techniques used to explore problem spaces systematically in order to find solutions. They can be categorized into two main types:

### Informed Search Strategies

Informed search strategies, also known as heuristic search strategies, use additional knowledge or heuristics to guide the search process towards more promising paths in the search space.

### Uninformed Search Strategies

Uninformed search strategies are algorithms that explore a search space without using any additional knowledge about the problem other than the information provided in the problem definition.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
**Definition**:
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It aims to traverse deeper into the search space before moving to siblings. DFS can be applied to both tree and graph structures.

DFS is characterized by the following steps:
1. Start at the initial node.
    - Set the initial node as the current node.
2. Explore as deeply as possible along a branch.
    - Select an unvisited child node if available and make it the current node.
    - If no unvisited child nodes are available, backtrack to the parent node.
3. Backtrack when no unexplored nodes remain.
    - Move back to the parent node.
4. Repeat until the goal is found or the entire graph is explored.

**Advantages**:
- Memory efficiency due to a depth-first approach.
- Suitable for searching in tree and graph structures.
- Efficient for finding paths in specific problem domains.
- May find solutions quickly.

**Common Problem Domains**:
- Graph traversal, maze solving, network routing, syntax analysis in compilers.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
**Definition**:
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, expanding outward from the initial node. It is a versatile algorithm used for searching and traversing tree and graph structures.

BFS is characterized by the following steps:
1. Start at the initial node.
    - Set the initial node as the current node.

## A* Algorithm
**Definition**:
A* (pronounced "A star") is a best-first search algorithm that combines elements of both Dijkstra's algorithm and Best-First Search. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost from the start node to the goal node and makes decisions based on both the cost incurred so far and the estimated remaining cost.

    - Select the node with the lowest total cost as the current node.
5. Explore the chosen node.
    - Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes.

## Beam Search
**Definition**:
Beam Search is a search algorithm that explores multiple paths simultaneously, keeping a limited number of the most promising paths, known as the "beam." This approach is particularly useful when the search space is large, and it's challenging to explore all possibilities exhaustively.

Beam Search can be characterized by the following steps:
1. Start with an initial set of paths (the beam).
    - Initialize the beam with one or more initial paths.
2. Generate and evaluate successor paths.
    - Create new paths by extending the current paths or generating alternatives.
3. Select the top-n successor paths based on evaluation.

## Hill Climbing
**Definition**:
Hill Climbing is a local search optimization algorithm that iteratively improves a solution by making small incremental changes. It moves toward higher or lower values of an objective function, depending on whether the goal is maximization or minimization.

Hill Climbing can be categorized into several types, including:
- Basic Hill Climbing
- Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing

    - Initialize the current solution, which can be randomly generated or obtained through other methods.
2. Generate neighboring solutions.
    - Create neighboring solutions by making small changes to the current solution.
3. Select the best neighbor that improves the objective.
    - Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution and choose the best one.
4. Replace the current solution with the selected neighbor.
    - Update the current solution with the best neighboring solution.
5. Repeat until a local optimum is reached or no improvement is possible.
    - Continue the process until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a local maximum or a predefined number of iterations.

**Advantages**:
- Simplicity and ease of implementation.
- Efficiency in some cases, making it suitable for local optimization problems.
- Memory efficiency, as it only requires storage for the current solution and its neighbors.

**Disadvantages**:

## Tabu Search (Additional Method)
**Definition**:
Tabu Search is an enhancement of basic hill climbing that incorporates a "tabu" list to avoid revisiting recent states. It aims to explore a diverse solution space while preventing cycles and escaping local optima.

Tabu Search can be categorized into various types based on specific tabu list strategies.

Tabu Search is characterized by the following steps:
1. Start with an initial solution.
    - Initialize the current solution.
2. Generate neighboring solutions.
    - Create neighboring solutions by making small changes to the current solution.
3. Select the best neighbor that is not in the tabu list.
    - Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution and choose the best one that is not tabu.
4. Add the selected neighbor to the tabu list.
    - Update the tabu list with the chosen solution, preventing it from being revisited in the near future.
5. Repeat until a stopping criterion is met.
    - Continue the search process, adjusting the tabu list and exploring new solutions.

**Advantages**:
- Avoids cycling and local optima by prohibiting revisits to recent states.
- Suitable for complex optimization problems with a rugged search space.

**Disadvantages**:

## Simulated Annealing (Additional Method)
**Definition**:
Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that explores solutions by accepting worse solutions with decreasing probability. It mimics the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is slowly cooled to minimize defects.

Simulated Annealing can be adapted to different problem domains by adjusting its cooling schedule.

Simulated Annealing is characterized by the following steps:
1. Start with an initial solution.
    - Initialize the current solution, often obtained through randomization or other methods.
2. Generate a neighboring solution.
    - Create a neighboring solution by making a small change to the current solution.
3. Calculate the change in the objective function (delta E).
    - Compute the difference in objective function values between the current and neighboring solutions.
4. Accept the neighbor if it improves the objective or with a certain probability if it worsens it.
    - Accept the neighboring solution if delta E is negative or with a probability determined by the current temperature.
5. Repeat until convergence or a stopping condition is met.
    - Adjust the temperature and continue exploring the search space.

**Advantages**:
- Can escape local optima by accepting worse solutions, aiding exploration.
- Flexibility in exploration, allowing for both exploration and exploitation phases.

**Disadvantages**:

4. Implement actions to move from one state to another.
    - Execute the planned actions to progress toward the final goal.
5. Repeat until the final goal is achieved.
    - Continue solving subgoals until the ultimate goal is reached.

**Advantages**:
