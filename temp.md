# Problem-Solving and Search Methods

This repository provides a comprehensive summary of various problem-solving and search methods commonly used in computer science and artificial intelligence. Each method is explained in terms of its definition, types, steps, advantages, disadvantages, and common problem domains where they are applied.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
### Definition
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It aims to traverse deeper into the search space before moving to siblings.

### Types
- Basic DFS
- Iterative Deepening DFS

### Steps
1. Start at the initial node.
    - Set the initial node as the current node.
2. Explore as deeply as possible along a branch.
    - Select an unvisited child node if available and make it the current node.
    - If no unvisited child nodes are available, backtrack to the parent node.
3. Backtrack when no unexplored nodes remain.
    - Move back to the parent node.
4. Repeat until the goal is found or the entire graph is explored.

### Advantages
- Memory efficiency due to a depth-first approach.
- Suitable for searching in tree and graph structures.
- Efficient for finding paths in specific problem domains.
- May find solutions quickly.

### Disadvantages
- May not find shortest paths.
- Can get stuck in deep branches.
- Not always optimal (finds deeper or costlier solutions).
- Incomplete (infinite depth).

### Common Problem Domains
- Graph traversal, maze solving, network routing, syntax analysis in compilers.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
### Definition
BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, expanding outward from the initial node.

### Types
- Simple BFS
- Complete BFS (exhaustively explores the entire search space)
- Optimal BFS (finds the shortest path)

### Steps
1. Start at the initial node.
    - Set the initial node as the current node.
2. Explore all neighboring nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.
    - Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes.
3. Repeat until the goal is found or the entire graph is explored.
    - Dequeue the next node from the queue and set it as the current node.

### Advantages
- Completeness (guaranteed to find a solution if one exists).
- Optimality (finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps).

### Disadvantages
- Memory-intensive for large search spaces.
- Not suitable for some problem domains with complex branching.

### Common Problem Domains

### Steps
1. Start at the initial node.
    - Set the initial node as the current node.
2. Evaluate the heuristic for available nodes.
    - Calculate a heuristic value for each unvisited neighboring node.
3. Choose the node with the best heuristic value.
    - Select the node with the lowest heuristic value as the current node.
4. Explore the chosen node.
    - Enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes.
5. Repeat until the goal is found or the search terminates.
    - Dequeue the next node from the queue and set it as the current node.

### Steps
1. Start with an initial set of paths (the beam).
    - Initialize the beam with the initial path(s).
2. Generate and evaluate successor paths.
    - Create new paths by extending the current paths.
3. Select the top-n successor paths based on evaluation.
