# Problem-Solving and Search Methods

This repository provides a comprehensive summary of various problem-solving and search methods commonly used in computer science and artificial intelligence. Each method is explained in terms of its definition, types, steps, advantages, disadvantages, and common problem domains where they are applied.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
### Definition
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It aims to traverse deeper into the search space before moving to siblings.

### Types
- Basic DFS
- Iterative Deepening DFS

### Steps
1. Start at the initial node.
2. Explore as deeply as possible along a branch.
3. Backtrack when no unexplored nodes remain.
4. Repeat until the goal is found or the entire graph is explored.

### Advantages
- Memory efficiency due to a depth-first approach.
- Suitable for searching in tree and graph structures.
- Efficient for finding paths in specific problem domains.
- May find solutions quickly.

### Disadvantages
- May not find shortest paths.
- Can get stuck in deep branches.
- Not always optimal (finds deeper or costlier solutions).
- Incomplete (infinite depth).

### Common Problem Domains
- Graph traversal, maze solving, network routing, syntax analysis in compilers.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
### Definition
BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, expanding outward from the initial node.

- Optimal BFS (finds the shortest path)

### Steps
1. Start at the initial node.
2. Explore all neighboring nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.
3. Repeat until the goal is found or the entire graph is explored.

### Advantages

### Disadvantages
- Memory-intensive for large search spaces.
- Not suitable for some problem domains with complex branching.

### Common Problem Domains

- AO* Algorithm

### Steps
1. Start at the initial node.
2. Evaluate the heuristic for available nodes.
3. Choose the node with the best heuristic value.
4. Explore the chosen node.
5. Repeat until the goal is found or the search terminates.

### Advantages
- Efficiency with a good heuristic.
- Can guarantee optimality with A* and AO*.
- Effective for pathfinding and search problems.
- Memory-efficient compared to BFS.

### Disadvantages
- Sensitivity to heuristic quality.

- Relies heavily on the quality of the heuristic function.
- Sensitive to the initial state.
- Suitable only for well-defined problems with clear goals and costs.

### Common Problem Domains

## Beam Search
### Definition
Beam Search is a search algorithm that explores multiple paths simultaneously, keeping a limited number of the most promising paths (the "beam").

### Types
- Beam width (n) = 1 (equivalent to hill climbing).
- Beam width (n) = infinite (equivalent to Best-First Search).

### Steps
1. Start with an initial set of paths (the beam).
2. Generate and evaluate successor paths.
3. Select the top-n successor paths based on evaluation.
4. Repeat until the goal is found or a stopping criterion is met.

### Advantages
- Efficiency and faster convergence compared to BFS.
- Quality of results depends on the beam width.

- Sensitive to the choice of beam width.
- Can miss out on some parts of the search space.

### Common Problem Domains
- When approximate solutions work, large search spaces, fast solutions, resource scarcity.

## Hill Climbing

### Steps
1. Start with an initial assignment of variables.
2. Check if the assignment satisfies all constraints.
